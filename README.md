Real Time Computer Graphics with WebGL

## How to run

First of all you will need to install the dependencies by running:

```bash
yarn
```

### Development

First serve the files with:

```bash
yarn serve
```

Then run:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will simply transpile the `typescript` code and update the transpilation whenever there is change on the source code. To see changes you will have to refresh the page.

### Production

You build the project as follows:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will transpile the `typescript` code as well as minify it.

And you deploy it with:

```bash
yarn serve
```

Without custom configuration, the server will commonly run on port $3000$. To preview the GUI on you browser open http://localhost:3000.

You can now easily navigate through the folders of this project, that contains all the examples from the book.

### Testing

In order to run the unit test, execute the following:

```bash
yarn test
```
