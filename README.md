Real Time Computer Graphics with WebGL

## How to run

First of all you will need to install the dependencies by running:

```bash
yarn
```

### Development

First serve the files with:

```bash
yarn serve
```

Then run:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will simply transpile the `typescript` code and update the transpilation whenever there is change on the source code. To see changes you will have to refresh the page.

### Production

You build the project as follows:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will transpile the `typescript` code as well as minify it.

And you deploy it with:

```bash
yarn serve
```

Without custom configuration, the server will commonly run on port $3000$. To preview the GUI on you browser open http://localhost:3000.

You can now easily navigate through the folders of this project, that contains all the examples from the book.

### Testing

In order to run the unit test, execute the following:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Code

### Chapter 1: Getting Started

- [Getting Info](./src/ch02/09/): Shows how to obtain various information about VBOs and IBOs.
- [JSON Data](./src/ch02/10/): Shows how to obtain work with JSON data that defines objects.
- [Car](./src/ch02/11/): Renders a Nissan car using JSON data as the input data.

### Chapter 3: Lights

- [Goraud Shading with Goraud Lights](./src/ch03/01/): Renders an sphere while applying Goraud Shading in combination with the Lambert Light Model.
- [Goraud Shading with Goraud Lights](./src/ch03/02/): Modifies the previous example to animate the ligth.
- [Goraud Shading with Phong Lights](./src/ch03/03/): Renders an sphere while applying Goraud Shading in combination with the Phong Light Model.
- [Phong Shading with Phong Lights](./src/ch03/04/): Renders an sphere while applying Phong Shading and the Phong Light Model.
- [Moving lights with Goraud Shading and Goraud Lights](./src/ch03/05/): Renders a wall while applying Goraud Shading and the Lambert Light Model, while also allowing you to move the light direction.
- [Positional Lighting with Phong Lights](./src/ch03/06/): Renders a moving scene that is iluminated by a single positional light using the Phong Shading model alongside the Phong Light model.
- [Car with Lights](./src/ch03/07/): Renders a moving scene showing a car iluminated by a positional light.

### Chapter 4: Camera

- [Camera Translation](./src/ch04/01/): Renders a scene where you can translate the camera/objects depending on the transformation matrix you choose.
- [Camera Rotation](./src/ch04/02/): Renders a scene where you can rotate the camera/objects depending on the transformation matrix you choose.
- [Camera Transformation](./src/ch04/03/): Renders a scene where you can translate or rotate the camera/objects depending on the transformation matrix you choose.
- [Camera Types](./src/ch04/04/): Renders a scene that you can translate/rotate using the different camera types: tracking and orbiting.
- [Camera Controller](./src/ch04/05/): renders a complex object (a car) and defines a camera that can be interacted with using the mouse.
- [Camera Projections](./src/ch04/06/): interact with the scene using your mouse or your keyboard, this will make the camera 'move'. Also you are able to switch between projection modes using the controller on your right, so you can choose between perspective or orthographic mode.
- [Canvas Size](./src/ch04/07/): test how changing the size of the viewport using gl.viewport changes how you render the scene.

### Chapter 5: Animations

- [Simple Animation](./src/ch05/01/): showcase a simple animation of two objects. Such that you can see how to apply both global and local transforms.
- [Parametric Curves](./src/ch05/02/): show how to use parametric curves to control an animation.
- [Linear Interpolation](./src/ch05/03/): showcase how the linear interpolation method work.
- [Linear Interpolation](./src/ch05/04/): showcase how different interpolation methods work.

### Chapter 6: Color, Depth Testing and Alpha Blending

- [Per-Vertex Coloring](./src/ch06/01/): show the difference between constant coloring and per-vertex coloring.
- [Multiple Lights](./src/ch06/02/): show how to render different light sources on the same scene.
- [Uniform Arrays](./src/ch06/03/): show how to render different light sources on the same scene by using uniform arrays.
- [Spot Lights](./src/ch06/04/): show how to use spotlights or what we call directional point lights.
- [Attenuated Lights](./src/ch06/05/): show how to use spotlights or what we call directional point lights. . But with a twist! We know add an attenuation factor based on the angle between the light and the surface that makes for a more realistic effect.
- [Blending](./src/ch06/06/): see how different blending configuration changes the scene.
- [Face Culling](./src/ch06/07): showcase how face culling works.
- [Rendering Order](./src/ch06/08): shows how rendering ordering affects the effect of transparency.

### Chapter 7: Textures

- [Rendering a Texture](./src/ch07/01/): show how to render a simple texture.
- [Rendering Different Textures](./src/ch07/02): on this example we show how to pick between different images to act as a texture.
- [Texture Filtering Modes](./src/ch07/03): we show how different texture filter modes work.
- [Texture Wrapping Modes](./src/ch07/04): we show how to use the different texture wrapping modes.
- [Multiple Textures](./src/ch07/05/): this example shows how to use multiple textures.
- [Cube Maps](./src/ch07/06/): on this example we demonstrate how to use cube maps.

### Chapter 8: Picking

- [Editor](./src/ch08/01): on this example we display a very simple scene editor that uses picking techniches to transform objects.
